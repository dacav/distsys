Stuff to do
===========

1.  Chech how to distribute stuff over the Internet;
    [Note: meanwhile a generic approach has been used];

2.  Logging system based on Event Handler (handle this *pumps
    shotgun*). Also rename decently the fucker;

3.  Replace configuration system (from conf, to application configuration)
    [Note: log_serv remaining];
