Stuff to do
===========

0.  Make channel filter aware of service communication (policies? no kill,
    no delay);

1.  Add a state for which nodes are active but still not executing the
    user code (the idea is: don't start until initialization is completed,
    then go for a start message.

2.  Chech how to distribute stuff over the Internet;
    [Note: meanwhile a generic approach has been used];

3.  Logging system based on Event Handler (handle this *pumps
    shotgun*). Also rename decently the fucker;

4.  Replace configuration system (from conf, to application configuration)
    [Note: log_serv remaining].
