% This function assumes the message with its envelope, namely a tuple
% {To, From, Msg}.
%
% Filters are functions which can either manipulate the message or send
% it. In the first case they have to return a new message with envelope,
% and the next filter will be executed; in the second case they have to
% return the sent message itself.
%
% If no filter sends the data, a regular sending will be achieved.
